HW6 - Indirect Addressing 

These are the hex values for the 8086 pointer registers. 

    SI=000B  DI=0007  BX=0014  BP=00EB

These are the hex values for the Data Segment shown 16 bytes per line. 

    0000: 04 7A C4 0F 25 B3 89 B4 9B 62 8C BE 8D A0 D3 26 
    0010: DB 5F D7 94 60 A1 E5 31 74 E8 C5 B6 B5 ED 9A CA
